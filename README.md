Course projects in AI

This repository contains the projects done at USC as a part of the AI course. I scored 100 in each of them, so they've passed all the test-cases.
1. Search -  A code to find out paths between points using BFS, DFS, UCS and A* search.
2. Game Playing - Finding the best possible next move based on minimax tree algorithm and alpha-beta pruning.
3. Inference in FOL - Used resolution inference procedure to deduce inferences from a given KB.
